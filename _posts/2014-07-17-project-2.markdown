description: I consider myself a big time nerd! I love joining fandoms and in my free time, spend way too much time fixated them. I love buying merch and going to comic con, and even just discussing my interests with my friends. Usually, most of my interests revolve around them, though I really do enjoy classic board games and true-crime tv shows/podcasts. My main fandom fixations are currently Star Wars, The Last of Us, and Game of Thrones.
